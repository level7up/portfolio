## Notes and Lessons Learned

1. **Component Organization**: Separating sections into individual components made the codebase more maintainable and easier to update.

2. **Animation Performance**: Using Framer Motion's `useInView` hook helped optimize animations by only triggering them when components are visible.

3. **Theme Implementation**: Creating a theme context with localStorage persistence ensures user preferences are remembered between visits.

4. **Responsive Design**: Using Tailwind's responsive utilities made it easier to create a mobile-first design that adapts to different screen sizes.

5. **Next.js App Router**: The App Router in Next.js 15 provides a clean and intuitive way to organize pages and layouts.
